This is my first blog post. I'm going to try and write a tiny static site generator in <code class="language-c">C</code>.

Here's a second paragraph^[1]. Notice how blank lines separate them.
This line continues the same paragraph since there's no blank line above.

^[1]: This is a footnote example.

And a third paragraph here. I'm going to need to expand my generator to handle more complex formatting.
But for now, this is a good start!

# Level 1 Heading

## Level 2 Heading

### Level 3 Heading

#### Level 4 Heading

##### Level 5 Heading

###### Level 6 Heading

**Bold text**

__Italic text__

==Highlighted text==

`Inline code snippet`

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
