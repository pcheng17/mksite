<pre><code class="language-c">int snprintf ( char * s, size_t n, const char * format, ... );</code></pre>

This method composes a string with the same format as
<code class="language-c">printf</code>,
but instead of printing it to standard output, it writes the result to the string
<code class="language-c">s</code>,
which has a maximum size of <code class="language-c">n</code> bytes, **including the null terminator**.

If the resulting string would be longer than <code class="language-c">n-1</code> characters,
it is truncated to fit, and a null terminator is added; hence, the <code class="language-c">n-1</code>.

The  method returns the number of characters that would have been written if there was enough space in the buffer,
**not counting the null terminator**.
